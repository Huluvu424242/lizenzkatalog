                            Preamble

The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works.

[[use#app]]
[[pol#distribution if="Distribution of modified versions" then="allow" because="Copyleft ensures user freedoms are preserved"]]

To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you
have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software,
or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.


[[pol#distribution=if="Distribution of modified versions" then="allow" because="Copyleft ensures user freedoms are preserved"]]
[[pol#linking=if="Static linking with proprietary software" then="deny" because="GPLv3 requires derivative works to be GPL-compatible"]]
[[pol#tivoization=if="Use in locked-down hardware" then="deny" because="Tivoization clause forbids denial of user modification freedom"]]
[[pol#patent=if="Patent retaliation" then="allow" because="GPLv3 includes explicit patent-retaliation protection"]]
[[pol#network=if="Network use (SaaS)" then="conditional" because="AGPL required for network copyleft; GPLv3 itself is silent"]]
[[pol#warranty=if="Warranty disclaimer" then="allow" because="GPLv3 permits distribution without warranty provided the disclaimer is kept intact"]]
[[pol#notice=if="License text inclusion" then="allow" because="GPLv3 requires full license text to be included with distribution"]]
[[pol#source=if="Providing source code" then="allow" because="GPLv3 mandates corresponding source for distributed binaries"]]
